# U.S. Department of Energy Datasets #

List of significant datasets from the U.S. Department of Energy, categorized by the Offices, National Laboratories, and/or functionality.


## Why This Project ##

For the first [Energy Open Data Roundtable](http://energy.gov/eere/articles/first-ever-energy-open-data-roundtable-catalyzes-value-big-data-revolution-energy) on Apr 29, 2015, the [Center of Open Data Enterprise](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/convene) created a [Microsoft Word document](data/3-Energy%20Roundtable%20-%20DRAFT%20DOE%20data%20sets%204-23-15.docx) of DOE datasets relevant to the conference discussion.

In addition to providing meta-data of the datasets as a Word Doc, we felt that it was important to also deliver it as machine readable data in both [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) formats.

Thus, this project was formed.

We then realized that if the data is in machine readable format, then there is no need to maintain a human readable version in parallel. Instead, we can use the latest JSON data to render our [index page](index.html) dynamically. With this simple insight, the human readable form will never get out of sync with the machine readable form.
